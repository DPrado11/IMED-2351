                <p>Use this text to take your speed test: This strange, but fairly common creature is a type of mammal. It's about the size of a rabbit, has six legs and a short, strong tail. They have a thick, but delicate skin covered in long, soft hairs which is usually either blue, dark brown or light bronze or a combination of these colors. They live in frozen areas and are fairly common. They're herbivores and their small, long mouths, their teeth and rough tongue are ideal for eating berries. These creatures are calm and they have no real territory and wish to avoid conflicts. </p>
